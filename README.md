# Pacman

The beloved vintage Pacman game with Flutter Animations and Sound Effects compatible in both Andriod and IOS.

  
## Project Structure: 
The rough breakdown of the current state of the game will consist of 
Game Logic, I/O and Sound Effects. The game logic consists of collision 
detection, scoring, and Ghost AI. The I/O includes mostly interaction 
with touch and if time forbids, maybe a keyboard/joystick to make it accessible 
on PCs too.  
  
Further during the timeline, the plan is to improve the frame rate, add a 
ranking system based on highscore and implement shortest path 
algorithm for Ghosts to target Pacman in the game.
